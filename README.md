## General Information
- General Information
  Project: Build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.
  Target Variable: 'cnt' (total bike rentals, combining casual and registered users).
  Objective: Help BoomBikes forecast bike demand post-pandemic using various factors (e.g., weather, season, year).
  
- Project Backgroup
  BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has faced revenue drops due to COVID-19.
  They aim to predict future bike demand after the pandemic ends, adjusting strategies to match customer needs.
  
- Business problem project is trying to solve
  Problem: Predict bike-sharing demand after the pandemic to align business strategies.
  Goal: Understand the factors affecting bike demand (e.g., weather, season, year) to adjust operations and maximize profits.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
  Dataset: Daily bike demand data for BoomBikes in the US, including features like weather, season, year, and user types (casual and registered).
  Target Variable: 'cnt' (total number of rentals on a given day).
